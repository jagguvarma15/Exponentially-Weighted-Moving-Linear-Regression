# Exponentially-Weighted-Moving-Linear-Regression (EWMLR)
This repository implements the novel Exponentially Weighted Moving Linear Regression (EWMLR) model, which extends the traditional Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) by integrating linear regression for improved time series analysis.

<p> 
EWMLR emphasizes recent observations while capturing broader linear trends, making it highly effective for volatile 
time series data and real-time decision-making.

  <li><strong>Real-Time Applications:</strong> Suitable for financial analysis, demand forecasting, and other dynamic environments.</li>
  <li><strong>Demonstrated Use Case:</strong> Evaluated on Bitcoin stock price data, showcasing its ability to outperform traditional EWMA models.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Python:</strong> Core programming language for implementation.</li>
  <li><strong>Libraries:</strong> NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data processing and visualization.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future Work</h2>
